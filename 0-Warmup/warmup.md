4. Briefly describe what you want to get out of this class:
I want to gain a deep understanding of how the Linux operating system interacts with software and hardware, focusing on systems programming with C. I aim to improve my proficiency in debugging, process management, and network programming to build more efficient and reliable software.

5. Briefly describe any concerns you might be having with being successful in this class (if any):
My primary concern is adapting to the complexity of systems programming in C, especially since I'm relatively new to C programming. However, I am confident that consistent practice and using the available resources will help me overcome these challenges.
